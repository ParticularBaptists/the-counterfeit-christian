# First Application



1. A Terror to Sinners. Tremble you that live wicked Lives, remember the unclean Spirit dwells in you, and has Power over you, your Hearts are his Habitation, he rules in you, and takes you Captive at his Will. If in this State you die, you are undone for ever.



2. See to it, you that are Professors, lest you are also de∣ceived. What is a reformed Life without a changed Heart? To cast off the gross Acts of Sin, will not avail you any thing, without the evil Habits are broke, and you renewed in the Spirit of your Mind. Though you seem to be godly to Men, yet God knows your Hearts, and how they stand affected to him, and to true real Godliness. A form of Religi∣on will never save you; and though you may have got some ground against Satan, and he seems to have left you, or is gone out, yet take heed he does not return again with greater strength, and get you into stronger Bonds now, than he had before. But because this will be more fully opened in the next place, I shall at present say no more to it now.



3. This also affords much Comfort to God's People. Sa∣tan sets upon you, and fain he would subject your Souls to himself, and take Possession of your Hearts, but he cannot prevail, you have got one in you who is stronger than Satan, who will preserve you to his Heavenly Kingdom. But no more at this time: I shall leave what I have said to the Blessing of God.



THE unclean Spirit that goes out,\*

Of Men that vicious are,

Doth oft-times seek and search about,

For rest both here and there:

And fain would he make his abode,

In places dry and clean;

And ruin all the Saints of God,

Which hath been often seen.

But thou, O Lord, dost them preserve,

And in them thou dost dwell,

So that from thee they cannot swerve,

To be o're-come by Hell.

Which Satan seeing, strait-way goes,

To his own Dwelling place,

And with him brings more dismal Woes,

On such who want thy Grace.

Who of it being empty quite,

Tho swept and garnished,

He enters in, and with strong might

They captive all are led,

And overcome by him again,

Through curst Hypocrisy,

And in them he does rule and reign,

Which few are brought to see.

What cause have such thy Praise to sing,

Who are renew'd by thee?

Whose Heart thy Habitation is,

They always happy be.
