# APPLICATION.



This may inform us of the Cause and Reason there is so great\* Reproach brought upon Religion, and on the Ways of God, and on the People of God, by some who profess the Go∣spel. Alas, many of them who are called Saints, we may justly fear are but counterfeit Christians, such who never ex∣perienced a true Work of Grace; they may have knowing Heads, but unsanctified Hearts. And from hence it is there are so many proud Persons in many Congregations, who with brazen Foreheads will brave it out, with impudent Faces, in the pre∣sence of Christ's faithful Ministers; and though reproved, and told of their cursed Pride and abominable Dresses, high and shameful Towers, hateful to God and good Men, yet reform not, will not deny themselves of their filthy Lusts, tho the Name of God and Religion is exposed to great Reproach and Contempt there∣by, and the Hearts of sincere Christians wounded, and mourn for it bitterly before the Lord. If they had but a spark of true Grace, could they ever stand it out thus against the Gun-shot of Hea∣ven? How fearless do they seem under the ratling Peals of the Thunder of Heaven? They regard not the whetted Sword of the Almighty, nor the bending of his dreadful Bow; nor mind the Arrows that are just upon the String, who is ready to send forth his Anger with Fury, and his Rebukes in Flames of Fire.



Moreover,\* from hence it is also there are so many covetous, earthly, and hard-hearted Professors and Members in Chur∣ches. Alas, you may tell them of this abominable Sin a thou∣sand times over, and all to no purpose, their Hearts \('tis to be feared\) are set upon their Covetousness, they love the World more than the Word, nay, more than God or Jesus Christ; and yet, under a Cloak of Religion, shelter them∣selves as if all was well, and they good Christians: And because they covet no Man's Goods but their own, and so are not guil∣ty of Theft, they conclude they are not chargeable with this Sin of Covetousness; though Christ's poor Members are not re∣garded, the Naked are not clothed,\* nor the Hungry fed, nor the Sick visited. They will give something 'tis true, but not ac∣cording to the Need and Necessity of the Poor, nor according to their Ability: nor is it out of Love to Christ, nor to his poor Saints neither, they give what they do give, may be to free themselves from Reproach, or to quiet their own Con∣sciences. And hence it is likewise there are so many Whispe∣rers, Tatlers and Backbiters in Congregations, and so conse∣quently so much trouble and disorder in our Churches. Tho Godly Christians may be guilty of great Disorders and many Infirmities, yet I am perswaded, were there not many false and deceitful, carnal and hypocritical Professors, it would ne∣ver be as it is. What makes the best Design that ever was a∣mongst us, for the promoting the Interest of Christ, and good of the Churches, so neglected, and like to sink in the Bud, but the great discouragement these sort of People lay it under? They have no mind to such a good and great Work, they are for enriching themselves, and to lay into their own Coffers and Treasuries, but not to cast into Christ's Treasury. And this evil Example of theirs, lays a Temptation on sincere and up∣right Men and Women. What do such and such do? they are far richer than I, and they will do nothing. To these let me speak one word: Why, will you do no more for God, because some who love him not will do nothing? Alas, you had need do the more: I am perswaded you would not willingly be found foolish Virgins in the Day of Christ. How do you know but these very Men shall be found to be such who value the gratify∣ing of a base Lust, above the discharging a holy and acceptable Duty to Christ? who give more to deck and adorn their Hou∣ses, and please the base Lust of their Children, than they will give to promote the Gospel, and recover the languishing Interest of Jesus Christ that is in our hands. And may not this be the reason our Assemblies are so thin on Lecture-days? is it not because the Hearts of People are not right with God? Can god∣ly Christians be always under the same Temptation? Can Sin predominate in them, and they act thus habitually to the scan∣dal of their sacred Religion? Can Sin be in the Affections of Saints, because there are some Infirmities in their Conversati∣ons? Is not a true Child of God quickly convinced of his Fault? and doth he not straitway reform? But this is a constant course of evil, and wilfully persisting in: nay, and ye shall in∣cur their displeasure perhaps if you deal plainly with them. Sure Christ is at the Door. Now the Kingdom of Heaven may cer∣tainly be compared to ten Virgins, five wise, and as many foo∣lish: read the latter end of Mat. 24. and the beginning of the 25th Chapter. Multitudes of Foolish Virgins, 'tis to be feared, are now got into the Church, as Christ signifies it would be a little before his Coming, whose latter end will be worse than the first.



This also reproves those who foment such Notions,\* and strive to distil them into the Minds of People that are absurd, and tend to blind and ruin their Souls, telling them they are in the Covenant of Grace, and Church-Members, by their Parents Faith, and have the Seal of the Covenant; yet I could never learn what it doth seal or make firm to them. For a Seal, all know, usually makes sure all that is contained in the said Cove∣nant. Shall they miss of the Blessings of the Covenant of Grace who have it sealed to them? Alas, hereby 'tis to be feared, ma∣ny think they are in a good Condition, though never united by saving Faith to Jesus Christ. Can it seal, and not seal Cove∣nant-Mercies to them? Or can they perish after they are in the Covenant, and have the Seal of it? Circumcision was a Seal, 'tis true,\*of that Faith Abraham had, being yet uncircumcised; it was not a Seal of that Faith which he had not, but of the Faith which he had; and therefore it could not be a Seal to his Male Infants of the Righteousness of their Faith which they had, being yet uncircumcised, because they had no such Faith before Circumcision, as to believe in God, and to have it impu∣ted to them for Righteousness, as had Abraham their Father, to whom Circumcision was only called a Seal of the Righteousness of the Faith which he had yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the Father of all them that believe. It was a Seal to him of the lat∣ter Blessing as well as the former;\* for the Promise that he should be the Heir of the World, the Apostle shews was not through the Law, nor in or through Circumcision, nor had any that dignity conferred upon them but Abraham only; which clearly shews Circumcision did not appertain to the Covenant of Faith.



Likewise it may reprehend another sort,\* who tell the People, they were made the Children of God, Members of Christ, and In∣heritors of the Kingdom of Heaven, in their Baptism, or rather Rantism. O the danger of this pernicious Doctrine! how ma∣ny flatter themselves with the Hopes of Heaven from this false Foundation, thinking they sucked in the true Faith, and true Religion, with their Mother's Milk, and were made Christians by a Priest's scattering a little Water on their Faces when Babes, tho they live in all manner of horrid Sins, and are Ene∣mies to the Life and Power of Godliness? This is a way of making Christians which Christ and his Apostles never taught; and it is a healing of the Hurt of the People slightly, taking them off from seeking after Grace and true Regeneration; for if they were made true Christians then, regenerated then, doubt∣less their State is good; and so 'tis to be feared, thousands of them conclude, and never doubt of their Salvation.



Moreover,\* it reproves all who rest on Morality; who, be∣cause they live a sober Life, and pay every Man his own, doing justly, &c. conclude all is well, yet look after no other Religion. And it also as much reprehends those who boast of their Know∣ledg and spiritual Attainments, they conclude their State is good, because they are Members of a true Church, and have been Baptized indeed, and break Bread, Read and Pray in their Families, and discharge all other External Duties of Re∣ligion, but rest wholly upon these things, and never were brought to be poor in Spirit, nor obtain real Union with Christ, but are ignorant of the Faith, of the Operation of God. What means the Pride of some? their Earthliness, Contenti∣on, Whispering, Backbiting, want of Love, Divisions, &c. shut∣ting their Eyes at further Light, and discovery of Truth? O look about you for the Lord's sake, lest after all your high Profession and Hopes of Heaven, you do not at last drop down to Hell.



Lastly;\* It reproves all such nice and scrupulous Persons, who seem to make it their chief Business to render all odious who are not of their own fantastical Humor; Women must not wear a bit of Lace, &c. nor a gold Ring, nor Men wear a Periwig, though never so short and modest, \(and advised to do it by able Physicians, for their Health-sake\) because the Apostle saith, 'Tis a shame for a Man to wear long Hair; therefore they run in∣to Extreams, and cut their Hair close to their Ears, and so dis∣guise themselves, and censure others as guilty of great Abomi∣nation, \(who will not imitate them\) as if the main Points of Religion lay in these foolish Formalities and Niceties, and as if none were to be taken for Godly Christians, but such who are just of their Height, and Length, and Breadth, and conform to them in these smaller things \(that may be lawful notwithstand∣ing what such say\); and render those odious, who are better than themselves, even as such, who hate Instruction, and cast God's Word behind them, &c. These Men seem to bear the exact I∣mage of the Pharisees of old; and though they thus strain at a Knat, yet at the same time seem to swallow a Camel. For one of this sort will be found, it is to be feared, guilty of horrid Lies and Slanders, back-biting and reproaching his Neighbours, seeming to be silled with Malice and Envy, rendering a great bo∣dy or multitude of godly Christians, as a vile and wicked Peo∣ple, without Exeption, because they deny Babes Baptism, as if they were Deceivers and cursed Impostors, yet a People sound in all the Essentials of true Religion, and of holy and gracious Lives,\* our Enemies themselves being Judges, and only differ from our Brethren in that one thing which no wise nor worthy Men make absolutely necessary to Salvation. And 'tis not unknown how many learned Persons, who in the Point of Baptism differ from us,\* have acknowledged that we have the Word of God plain for us in that matter: Moreover, have confessed, In∣fants Baptism is doubtful, and therefore called for Moderation and Charity. But little of this appears in some censorious Zea∣lots; though God \(but a few Years ago\) made a dreadful Ex∣ample of one Man for his evil, envious, and reproachful Pen, near this City, enough to make all to tremble: And it ought never to be forgotten, how he abused the People falsely called Anabaptists, in a small Pamphlet, is not unknown to many; and what Terror of Conscience he soon after fell under, and in De∣spair hanged himself in Bricklane,\* under the sense and Apre∣hension of God's fearful Wrath and Displeasure; crying out against himself, for writing that cursed Book, to the last; de∣claring that his State was worse than Cain's, Judah's, or Spirah's; and that he had touched the Apple of God's Eye, &c.



This may also reprove the Churches of Christ,\* and the Pa∣stors of them, more particularly, for their Carelessness and Negligence in receiving in Persons: tho I know none to charge, yet I am afraid we have generally failed herein. O that greater care may be taken for the time to come; 'tis not a great Church, but a holy and good Church Christ loves. I am perswaded it would be better with the Churches, if many were severed from them. But O how seldom have any been dealt with, either for Pride or Covetousness▪ as if we were not able to find out such Offender as well as others.



Moreover,\* it sharply reproves those Preachers whose great Bu∣siness 'tis to bring Men into visible Profession, and make them Members of Churches, whose Preaching tends more to bring Per∣sons to Baptism, and to subject to external Ordiances, than to shew them the necessity of Regeneration, Faith, or a changed Heart. For the Lord's sake take heed what you do, if you would be pure from the Blood of all Men. We too often see when People are got into Churches, they conclude all is well; and when Con∣version is preached, they do not think it concerns them, but others who are openly prophane: and thus they come to be blinded, may be to their own Destruction; and if their Blood do not lie at some of your Doors, it will be well. I am afraid some now adays like the Pharisees, may be said to compass Sea and Land to make Proselytes, but when made, are twofold more the Chil∣dren of Hell than before, as our Saviour intimates.



It may also put us all upon a strict Examination of our own Hearts,\* lest we should be found some of these false and coun∣terfeit Christians. And that we may clear our selves in this matter; Consider,



1. Were you ever throughly convinced of your sinful and lost Condition by Nature,\* and of that horrid Evil there is in Sin? Did you ever see Sin as the greatest Evil, most hateful to God, not only of the evil Effects of Sin, but also of the evil Nature of Sin, not only as it has made a Breach between God and Man, but has also defaced the Image of God in Man, and made us like the Devil,\* filling our Minds with Enmity against God, Godli∣ness, and good Men.



2. Is there no secret Sin lived in and favoured, the evil Ha∣bit never being broke? Is not the World more in your Affecti∣ons, Desires, and Thoughts, than Jesus Christ?



3. Are you willing to suffer and part with all that you have, rather than sin against God? Do you see more evil in the least Sin, than in the greatest Suffering?



4. Do you as much desire to have your Sins mortified as par∣doned, to be made holy as well as to be made happy? Do you love the Work of Holiness as well as the Reward of Holiness? Do you love the Word of God for that Purity which is in it, as well as the Advantage that comes by it?



5. Have you seen 〈◊〉 your own Righteousness as filthy Rags, and have you been made poor in Spirit?



6. Have you received a whole Christ with a whole Heart? A whole Christ comprehends all his Offices, and a whole Heart includes all our Faculties: Is not your Heart divided?



7. Is Christ precious to you,\* even the chiefest amongst ten thousand? Are you the same in private as in publick? Do you love Christ above Son or Daugh∣ter? Do you love the Person of Christ?



8. Can you bear Reproof kindly for your Faults, and look upon him your best Friend, that deals most plainly with you.



9. Do you more pry into your own Faults, than into the Miscarriages of others? Are you universal in your Obedience? And do you obey Christ's Word, his Commands, because you love him?



10. Have you been the same in a day of Adversity, as now you are in a day of Prosperity.



11. Can you say you hate Sin as Sin? Is your Mind spiritual, and set upon Heavenly things? Do you love the Saints, all the Saints, though some of them are not of your Sentiments in some Points of Religion?



12. Can you go comfortably on in the ways of Christ, though you meet with little esteem amongst the Saints? Can you stay your Souls upon God, though in Darkness, having no Light? Is all the stress of your Justification and Salvati∣on built upon Jesus Christ?



Consider of these few Questions, and do not doubt but that your Hearts are sincere, when you can give a comfortable Answer to them, though it be with some fear and doubts that still may arise in you. A true Christian is ready to mistake his Portion, and take that to be his, that belongs to an Hypocrite; as an Hypocrite on the other hand, mistakes that which belongs to him, and ap∣plies that to himself, which is the Portion of sincere Christians: but Grace is like a small Seed at first, that cannot be soon espied in the House, i.e. the Heart, especially when there is much Smoak and Darkness yet remaining.



But may be some may say,\* What you have said, tends to take us off of Holy Duties and Obedience.



God forbid:\* for though we would not have you rest or depend upon your Duties and Obedience; yet let me tell you, a godly Man, or he that is a true Christian,\* hath such Righteousness wrought in him, and by him, that exceeds the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees; if he had not, he could in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.



1. His Obedience and Righteousness flows from a Principle of Divine or Spi∣ritual Life, or from a Principle of saving Grace, or else they would be all but dead Works; and from thence he acts and doth all that he performs Godward.



2. He acts from a Principle of Faith, his Obedience flows from thence, see∣ing himself justified and accepted only in Jesus Christ.



3. He acts from a Principle of Love to Christ, and is also always the same, and for the hardest part of Religion, as well as for the easiest part of it. More∣over, he is as careful to •eep a good Conscience towards God, as to keep a Con∣science void of Offence, towards Men; he takes up all the Duties of Religion in Point of Performance, though he lays them all down in Point of Dependance. He is as careful of his Heart and Ways, that he ••y please God, and glorify him as much, as a Man can be that expects to merit God's Favour thereby; he knows he must attend upon the means of Salvation, as well as to expect Salva∣tion it self. 4. He exceeds all others in his end, which is the Honour and Glory of God, or to live to God on Earth, as well as to live with God in Heaven.



Lastly; How severely doth what we have said look upon all Self-righteous Per∣sons; and those proud People that boast of their Holiness and Perfection, that think they need no Repentance,\* O that they would consider it, and tremble before it is too late, and they perish eternally, for rejecting the chief Corner∣stone. Remember, unless ye believe that Christ is he, ye shall die in your Sins. Also it looks severely on all formal and carnal Christians who have nothing but a Name. Alas Sirs! If the painted Hypocrite, he that is so gloriously garnished with many great Gifts, Parts, Wisdom, Learning, and seeming Piety, is in a damnable Condition, what will become of you? Mourn O England▪ what a Num∣ber of filthy, debauched, treacherous, proud, drunken, swearing and unclean Christians \(as they are called\) hast thou in the Bowels of thee? they shew their Sin as Sodom, and hide it not, and yet glory as if they were the only Peo∣ple of God. Awake Sinners, before God's Judgments are poured out upon you, for certainly great Wrath is at the Door. God hath wrought Wonders for the Deliverance of this Nation, but ye slight and contemn them: Neither Judgments nor Mercy will humble you; what would you have, since nothing God doth, pleases you? Certainly the Almighty will not bear with you much longer, if you repent not.



But ye who are truly pious and sincere ones,\* rejoice, you who mourn for your own Sins, and for the Sins of the Land; you are secured from the hun∣gry Lion, your Day is coming, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ is near, your Re∣demption is at hand; lift up your Heads, and praise God for ever.



SAtan a Spirit is unclean,\*

From whom all Filth doth flow;

A wicked Heart his House has been,

There still he dwells also.

As all true Holiness O Lord,

Is from they self alone;

So we do find from thy bless'd Word,

Sin's from that wicked one:

And that he in a filthy Heart

Takes up his curs'd Abode;

So thou so good to thy Saints art,

In them to dwell, O God:

And that thou mightst Possession have,

Satan thou hast cast out:

And from all Filth our Souls to save,

Strange things hast wrought about.

Let such who garnish'd are by Art,

And common Graces, fear,

Whilst all those sing with joyful Heart

Who are indeed sincere.

Let Sinners and each Hypocrite,

Consider their sad doom;

Whilst Saints do sing, having in sight

The Glory that's to come.

The latter State of some Men will,

Be worser than before;

But Saints are happy and safe still,

And shall for ever-more.

FINIS.
